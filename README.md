Recoup is my first stand-alone project as a software developer. I hope you enjoy it!

To use Recoup, you will have to install the following packages from npm:

- npm i framer-motion (https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion)
- npm i notistack (https://www.npmjs.com/package/notistack)
- npm i uuid (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
- npm i react-router-dom (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
- npm i axios (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

Recoup has an associated back-end repository that can be found here: https://github.com/nickpaparo/capstone-recoup-api
